    <h1>week 3</h1>
    <p class="parag">In my first day I got comprehensive description about the company I work for. Henning, the leader showed me what are the startups main goals for the next few months and what are my part will be to reach these goals during the internship. <br><br>
        My task will be built up a social media profile on the most popular and -of course relevant - platforms. The company’s marketing part was effective, so I have to improve it. Beside that I will also have short rapid assignments which are not requires a long-term intervention as the social media profile operation, like video editing and flyer designing. <br><br>

        I embarked on my duties with a member card designing. It was important because in the business plan it has an essential part, so this must be done at the beginning. This is a normal member card for the customers which will provide discount in in certain services. We gathered the main character points with Henning about what data should be showed in the card and what is the goal of the card so I could based the design on these. All in all, I spent 9 hours to make it. I discussed with Henning about the layout and the structure in every design part if he is satisfied with the results. <br><br>

        I got an assignment to make a video for a presentation, which introduce the company entertainment’s strength and involves three principle: it is easy to learn, it is safety, and its enjoyment is not age-related. We agreed that the video will be 45-60 seconds long because it is a part of a 20 minutes long presentation. For this I got video and photo materials what others recorded in the last summer, so I could used these. However, I didn’t learn anything is the school, but fortunately I have some experience in video editing, so it was not that big challenge. I made the video in 2-3 hours and every necessary point was completed. I included the three mentioned principle and cut 6 videos with photos and text. I showed it some competent friends as a “usability test” and asked for feedback. The audience liked it and said some small changes what I fixed. Henning liked it as well and so he inserted it to his presentation. <br><br>
        I started the social media profile building on Wednesday I had some experience in this area, because I have a Youtube channel. But in the first 4-5 hours I only read articles and tips about how to built up an effective social media profile which is permanent and brings us costumers. <br><br>
        First I started with the Instagram. After I study templates for this I made a strategy plan for the next months highlighted the season months. It is about how do we have to upload content, what tone of voice will we use. I put an emphasis on our target group and the Instagram users’ golden circle. I started to create the Instagram profile for the company. Henning already created one few months ago, but it seemed it requires some changes and requires compliments.<br><br>
